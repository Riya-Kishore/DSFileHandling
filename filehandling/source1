Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next. 
These instructions are known as code, and computer programmers 
write code to solve problems or perform a task.

The end goal is to create something: that could mean anything from a web page, 
or a piece of software, or even just a pretty picture. 
That’s why computer programming is often described as a mix between art and 
science; it’s technical and analytical, yet creative at the same time.

Front-end development involves working with code that produces the elements 
that users can see and interact with; it’s all about how a website looks and feels.

Back-end web developers make sure the website works as it should do, 
and the code they write is normally invisible to users. Back-end web 
developers work with databases that store information such as customer details, 
and servers which are where databases (virtually) live.

The three main languages front-end developers need to know are:

    HTML
    Javascript
    CSS
