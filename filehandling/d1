hello !!

Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next. 
These instructions are known as code, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or perform a task.


Front-end development involves working with code that produces the elements that users can see and interact with; 
itâ€™s all about how a website looks and feels.

Back-end web developers make sure the website works as it should do, and the code they write is normally invisible to users. 
Back-end web developers work with databases that store information such as customer details, and 
servers which are where databases (virtually) live.
